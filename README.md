> My Eleventy template for Netlify

This template is a _slightly opinionated_ clean start for an Eleventy website/blog to be deployed to Netlify.

## WARNING

This template is still in a very early beta stage. Breaking changes will not be reported with a new major version till the first release.

## Features

It has just a few feature like:
* a `robots.txt` file and a `<meta name="robots">` dynamically adjusted 
* a collection is automatically created for each folder in `src` that doesn't start with `_`
* a `<meta name="generator">` popolated with the actual Eleventy version used on the project
* a dynamic `sitemap.xml`

The last two feature where taken by two post written by [Luciano Mammino](https://twitter.com/loige)
  ([1](https://dev.to/loige/create-a-sitemap-for-your-eleventy-website-25h), [2](https://dev.to/loige/add-a-generator-meta-tag-to-your-eleventy-website-48f1))

## Usage

Just use this repo as a template for your own. There's a button right in github to do just that
