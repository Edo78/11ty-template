> My Eleventy template for Netlify

This template is a clean start for an Eleventy website to be deployed to Netlify.

It has just a few feature like:
* a `robots.txt` file and a `<meta name="robots">` dynamically adjusted 
* a `<meta name="generator">` popolated with the actual Eleventy version used on the project
* a dynamic `sitemap.xml`

The last two feature where taken by two post written by [Luciano Mammino](https://twitter.com/loige)
  ([1](https://dev.to/loige/create-a-sitemap-for-your-eleventy-website-25h), [2](https://dev.to/loige/add-a-generator-meta-tag-to-your-eleventy-website-48f1))

## Usage

Just use this repo as a template for your own. There's a button right in github to do just that
